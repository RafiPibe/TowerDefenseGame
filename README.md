In my final project in Object Oriented Programming, I’m attempting to make a game based on a genre called “tower defense” on java. This game contains aspects such as world design, towers, enemy, waves, and also the path that will be used for the enemy to reach the finish line. The enemy will try to reach the finish line and your lives will decrease every time there is an enemy passed. The purpose of this game is to clear the level by defeating them so that they won’t reach the finish line. You will be given a currency that you use to buy towers. The higher the tower, the more expensive it gets but it's stronger. The longer the game gets or the higher the waves are, the harder it gets.
